<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p><a href="https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/">https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/</a></p>
<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>TPCTF is made by Kelvin Higgles, Calvin, lakewood999, <s>ctong502</s> ctong610, and Tim (?).</p>
<p>Kelvin Higgles - every problem that happens is his fault. He got 1st at HSF this year, so clearly he is an experienced hekkerer. Also, he wrote 22.1% of the problems.</p>
<p>Calvin is a "n00b at math, science, programming, cybersecurity, and suxxxxxx at CTFs." For example, he did not qualify for HSF. He also wrote about 58.8% of the problems. They're all "pretty bad."</p>
<p>lakewood999 is a freaking genius and child prodigy who is lazy and doesn't feel like doing anything. He wrote 14.7% of the problems.</p>
<p><s>ctong502</s> ctong610 is a person who "went to HSF" and "got first". He is lazy and doesn't feel like doing stuff. He also is really good at math (better than Tim??? (he beat him at Mathcounts State)). He wrote 4.4% of the problems.</p>
<p>Tim is a valuable member of the team <i>when he contributes</i> (basically never). He does algo problems when he works on CTFs (almost never). He is also really good at math (better than <s>ctong502</s> ctong610??? (he actually made AIME)). He wrote about 0.0% of the problems.</p>
<h3>Who are the sponsors?</h3>
<p>Sponsors are Digital Ocean and defund.</p>
<p>Digital Ocean is an actually legit sponsor who gave us $100 in Digital Ocean credits.</p>
